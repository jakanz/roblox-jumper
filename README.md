# roblox-jumper
A basic AutoHotkey script designed to virtually hold the spacebar down, repeatedly jumping to avoid **[AFK kicks in Roblox](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Player/Idled)**.

## Starting off
This script utilizes AutoHotkey, so you must install this program for this script to be used correctly. You can download the latest version of AutoHotkey **[directly from their home page](https://www.autohotkey.com)**. You can visit their **[alternate downloads page](https://www.autohotkey.com/download)** to download an earlier version as well.

## Using the script
Utilizing the script is pretty basic -- once AutoHotkey has finished installing, the last step is to simply run the file. The script is a *toggle script*, meaning you press the same key to start and stop the script, in this case being F1 *(or, if on a smaller keyboard, Function (fn) + 1)*. You can find information on how to change this hotkey for this script below.

### Remapping the script hotkey
Say you don't want to use the F1 key to start the script. That's okay, because you are able to remap the script to another key! To do so, simply right-click the file, (if on Windows 11, click "Show more options"), click "Edit Script," and choose the text editor of your choice. Usually, all AutoHotkey files (.ahk) are readable by any editor.

Here, you can change the hotkey used for the script to anything of your choice. Simply type any character and it will function as intended, just with a different starting gun. **Try keeping the asterisk before the hotkey assignment!** This isn't crucial to the function of the script, however it's recommended. You can view the [syntax for hotkeys in AutoHotkey's official documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm#Symbols).

## Enjoy the script!
I hope you enjoy this script as much as I do. So simple yet so practical. Now you can use your phone without leaning it against your spacebar!
